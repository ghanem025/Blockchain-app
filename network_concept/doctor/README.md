# Network Concept
These Python programs illustrate the basic concept of how networking would function between two nodes, namely the patient and HCP. 
The programs in this folder are needed to run the HCP node. This is not a fully functioning decentralized system, instead it is a prototype/concept on how two nodes would interact in a decentralized network.
The other node is the patient node that is stored in the patient folder, each folder will have its own instructions on how to setup the nodes.
