# Network Concept
These Python programs illustrate the basic concept of how networking would function between two nodes, namely the patient and HCP. 
The programs in the HCP folder are needed to run the HCP node. The ones in the patient folder run the patient node. Each will have 
there own README files to assist in testing and understanding how they work. This is not a fully functioning decentralized system, 
instead it is a prototype/concept on how two nodes would interact in a decentralized network.
