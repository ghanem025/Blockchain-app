Here are a couple of articles that are shorter in length and provide a simple overview of the topic:

    "Blockchain for Secure and Privacy-Preserving EHRs Sharing" by S. H. Aljawarneh and M. Al-Majali (2019)

This article is around 8 pages long and provides a brief introduction to blockchain technology and its potential applications in healthcare. It then discusses the benefits of using blockchain for electronic health record (EHR) sharing and outlines a proposed architecture for a blockchain-based EHR system.

    "Blockchain and Healthcare: Innovations, Challenges and Future Directions" by M. E. Ahmed, A. R. Rahman, and A. Al-Fuqaha (2020)

This article is around 14 pages long and provides a general overview of the use of blockchain technology in healthcare. It covers topics such as the benefits and challenges of using blockchain in healthcare, examples of blockchain-based healthcare applications, and future directions for the field.

Both of these articles are relatively short and provide a good introduction to the topic, so they may be a good place to start if you are short on time. However, keep in mind that they may not provide as much detail or depth as some of the longer articles and research papers.
